# uML---Iris-PCA

Load the Iris dataset.

Create a plot of the data using all features to show the positive and negative correlations between them.

Scale the data, then apply PCA to it. Use n_components = 3.

Plot the transformed version of the data.

Compare the two plots and comment on what redundancy is likely to have
been removed from the data.
