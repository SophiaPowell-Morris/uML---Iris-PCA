# uML---Iris-PCA

Load the Iris dataset.

Once the Iris dataset was loaded into the notebook, a feature plot was generated to show the positive and negative correlations between all the features. 

The data was then scaled so that PCA could be undertaken on the data, and the n_components = 3.

The transformed version of the data was plotted. 

The two plots were compared and any redundancies that appling PCA to the dataset likely removed was identified and discussed.
